    <h2>Welcome to my Dome</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Eshan Khan</strong>, a Mechatronics Engineering student who enjoys turning coffee into CAD models and chaos into functioning (mostly) mechanisms. I’ve always been drawn to solving tough problems—whether it’s designing a part that won’t explode under load or figuring out why my SolidWorks assembly just turned itself into a modern art sculpture. From firmware at Electrium Mobility to teaching at YRT, I’ve had a blast mixing hands-on work with brain-bending logic puzzles.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not sketching in AutoCAD or trying to remember why I created that weird constraint, you can find me at the gym. It’s the one place where gains are linear and bugs don’t exist (unless you count dropping a dumbbell on your foot). I also enjoy watching sci-fi movies and mentally critiquing their engineering accuracy—because who <em>really</em> believes a spaceship can turn like a racecar?
      </p>
      <p>
        Professionally, I’ve worked on firmware for embedded devices and led tutoring sessions where I explained math, physics, and how not to throw your calculator out the window. These experiences taught me to communicate clearly, adapt quickly, and stay calm when technology decides to do its own thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always looking for my next challenge—whether it’s a cool internship, a design problem, or just a debate over whether AutoCAD or SolidWorks is more stubborn. Let’s connect and build something awesome (or at least get it to compile).
